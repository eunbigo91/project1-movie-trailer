# Project: Movie-Trailer-Website

This is a website project dedicated to movie trailers for Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program. This project generates a static webpage through Python's movie object class. The webpage displays my favorite movies and links you to its appropriate trailer via Youtube.

##Excute this program
To generate the HTML file for the website, type the following command.
```
    $python entertainment_center.py
```
This will generate a html file named fresh_tomatoes.html in the same folder or it will overwrite the existing one if already exits. Also it will open a new tab on default browser and load the generated page.
